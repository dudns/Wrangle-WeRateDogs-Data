# Wrangle WeRateDogs Data


This project is a part of [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). 



### Project Overview 


The dataset that I wrangled (and analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. Though the numerators are almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. 
WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.
